App Name: Token Velocity Tracker

Description:
Token Velocity Tracker is a Mini App that measures how quickly a token moves between wallets, exchanges, and smart contracts. It analyzes transaction frequency, circulation speed, and rapid movement patterns to help users understand market activity and potential volatility triggers. Receive alerts when token velocity spikes or drops significantly.

Key Features:
 • Real-time tracking of token movement speed across the network
 • Alerts for abnormal velocity spikes or slowdowns
 • Analysis of circulation patterns and transaction frequency
 • Historical charts showing velocity trends over time
 • Dashboard to compare velocity metrics across multiple tokens

Use Case:
Ideal for traders, analysts, and on-chain researchers who want to detect early signs of market activity, identify potential volatility, and analyze token flow dynamics to make better trading decisions.

I need to edit the app metadata file to update the title and description, and I also need to create a new file for the logo image.  
Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can propose the exact changes.

A dynamic, futuristic logo depicting a stylized token sphere moving along a curved arrow path, with a digital grid background and subtle neon glow. The token is a glowing sphere with a subtle gradient, and the arrow is a sleek, translucent ribbon that loops around the sphere, indicating speed and movement. The overall color palette is dark with electric blue and teal accents, giving a high‑tech, data‑centric feel.
